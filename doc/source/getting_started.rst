Welcome to MusPy! We will go through some basic concepts in this tutorial.

.. Hint:: Be sure you have MusPy installed. To install MusPy, please run ``pip install muspy``.

In the following example, we will use `this JSON file <https://github.com/salu133445/muspy/blob/master/examples/example.json>`_ as an example.

First of all, let's import the MusPy library. ::

    import muspy

Now, let's load the example JSON file into a Music object. ::

    music = muspy.load("example.json")
    print(music)

Here's what we got. ::

    Music(metadata=Metadata(schema_version='0.0', title='Für Elise', creators=['Ludwig van Beethoven'], collection='Example dataset', source_filename='example.json'), resolution=4, tempos=[Tempo(time=0, qpm=72.0)], key_signatures=[KeySignature(time=0, root=9, mode='minor')], time_signatures=[TimeSignature(time=0, numerator=3, denominator=8)], downbeats=[4, 16], lyrics=[Lyric(time=0, lyric='Nothing but a lyric')], annotations=[Annotation(time=0, annotation='Nothing but an annotation')], tracks=[Track(program=0, is_drum=False, name='Melody', notes=[Note(time=0, duration=2, pitch=76, velocity=64), Note(time=2, duration=2, pitch=75, velocity=64), Note(time=4, duration=2, pitch=76, velocity=64), ...], lyrics=[Lyric(time=0, lyric='Nothing but a lyric')], annotations=[Annotation(time=0, annotation='Nothing but an annotation')])])

Hard to read, isn't it? Let's print it beautifully. ::

    music.print()

Now here's what we got.

.. code-block :: yaml

      schema_version: '0.0'

        pitch: 75
        duration: 2
        velocity: 64
      - time: 4
        pitch: 76
        duration: 2
        velocity: 64
      - time: 6
        pitch: 75
        duration: 2
        velocity: 64
      - time: 8
        pitch: 76
        duration: 2
        velocity: 64
      - time: 10
        pitch: 71
        duration: 2
        velocity: 64
      - time: 12
        pitch: 74
        duration: 2
        velocity: 64
      - time: 14
        pitch: 72
        duration: 2
        velocity: 64
      - time: 16
        pitch: 69
        duration: 2
        velocity: 64
      lyrics:
      - time: 0
        lyric: Nothing but a lyric
      annotations:
      - time: 0
        annotation: Nothing but an annotation

You can use dot notation to assess the data. For example, ``music.metadata.title`` returns the song title, and ``music.tempos[0].qpm`` returns the first tempo in qpm (quarter notes per minute). If you want a list of all the pitches, you can do ::

    print([note.pitch for note in music.tracks[0].notes])

Then you will get ``[76, 75, 76, 75, 76, 71, 74, 72, 69]``.

.. Hint:: ``music[i]`` is a shorthand for ``music.tracks[i]``, and ``len(music)`` for ``len(music.tracks)``.

There's more MusPy offers. Here is an example of data preparation pipeline using MusPy.
